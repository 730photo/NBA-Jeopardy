<h1>Overview:</h1>

<h3>For project #1, I created a simple game of Jeopardy.

-Once players come to the site the game is already loaded and they can start playing immediately.

-The game starts when the user clicks on a rectangle and a question pops up. If the user puts in the right answer they gain points, if they put in the wrong answer, they lose points.

-once you click on a rectangle, you can't click on it again.

-How many points are gined or lost is determined by the rectangle they click on.

-questions on the 1st row are worth 10 points, questions on the 2nd row are worth 20 points, questions on the 3rd row are worth 30 points, questions on the 4th row are worth 40 points, 
and questions on the 5th row are worth 50 points.

-if you decide to not answer a question once you click the rectangle, you lose points based on which rectangle you clicked on.

-when the game is over, you click the "FINISHED" button at the bottom of the page and whoever has the highest score wins. The "Finished" button also resets the game.
